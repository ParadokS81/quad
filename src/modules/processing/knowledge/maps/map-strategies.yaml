  key_strategies:
    - "Quad control is central - quad spawns above hill, accessible via strafejump from ring"
    - "Red armor room has multiple catwalk levels, high traffic area"
    - "Pent-to-window rocketjump is fundamental team movement"
    - "3 megas spread across map: SNG, pent area, center"
    - "Bridge is the large central area - not a small bridge"
    - "Flood red armor room from multiple entrances simultaneously"
    - "Pre-fire rockets/grenades at pent 5s before spawn"
    - "Station player at bridge stairs for catwalk + water coverage"

  author: "American McGee (1996)"
  size: large
  items:
    quad: 1
    pent: 0
    ring: 0
    red_armor: 2  # RA+mega room (backroom) and secret
    yellow_armor: 3  # Big room x2, tele
    mega: 2  # Big room upper, backroom
    rocket_launcher: 2  # High RL (quad area), low RL
    lightning_gun: 0  # No LG on this map
    grenade_launcher: 1
  key_strategies:
    - "No LG means rocket aim and strategy dominates"
    - "Key to dm2: control quad-nailgun-teleporter area"
    - "Tele always means YA tele specifically"
    - "One player defends low tele (never leaves post)"
    - "Quad runner cycles: quad -> water -> low -> backroom"
    - "Backroom has RA + mega + rockets - critical area"
    - "Secret room has second red armor, risky water exit"
    - "When losing control: spread at low to slow quad runner"
    - "Push strategy: RA+RL player goes tele with 2 weaker teammates as distraction"
    - "'Slipping' ALWAYS means going through YA tele to high - the only tele on dm2"
    - "'boomstick at [area]' means enemy has only SG there - context-dependent: safe to push OR warning for weak RL teammate"

  items:
    quad: 1
    pent: 0
    ring: 0
    red_armor: 0  # No RA on this map
    yellow_armor: 1
    green_armor: 1  # At bridge/green area

    rocket_launcher: 1
    lightning_gun: 0  # No LG on this map
    super_nailgun: 2
    grenade_launcher: 1
    super_shotgun: 1
  key_strategies:
    - "Shotgun-centric map due to light armor and no LG"
    - "Yellow armor control is foundational - most essential area"
    - "Mega room is the biggest room on the map"
    - "Green armor area is also called bridge"
    - "GL area connects yellow armor and quad"
    - "Save packs and ammo for teammates - weapon scarcity matters"
    - "Whole team can stack yellow armor if defended properly"
    - "Tight corridors create multi-kill opportunities"
    - "RL room timing critical - vulnerable from 3 directions"
    - "Flood yellow armor from spikes, gl-stairs, and sng simultaneously"
    - "No red armor, no pent, no LG, no ring on this map"

    - "Tower secures RL and yellow armor quickly"
    - "Cemetery tele can reach red, ring, or mega first"
    - "Coordinate openers based on spawn identification"
    - "Yard area has pent - key control point"

  key_strategies:
    - "Three vertical levels: floor, first-level, sewer"
    - "LG spawn reaches LG in 3 seconds with cell pack route to red"
    - "Fastest quad access from green/SSG spawn (3-4 sec)"
    - "Ring access from multiple spawns creates chaotic convergence"
    - "Pent accessible within 5 seconds from certain spawns"
    - "Water areas have ring, mega, RL - important sewer control"
