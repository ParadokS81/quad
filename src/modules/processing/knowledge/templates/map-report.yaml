# QW Voice Analysis - Per-Map Report Template
# Defines the structure of Claude's analysis output.
# Sections can be added, removed, or reordered here without code changes.
# The analyzer builds the analysis prompt dynamically from these sections.

sections:
  - id: match_summary
    title: "Match Summary"
    instruction: >
      Summarize the match: final score, map, teams, and key context.
      Note any standins or unusual roster situations.

  - id: communication_balance
    title: "Communication Balance"
    instruction: >
      Analyze per-player speaking stats (segments, speaking time, words, WPM).
      Is the distribution healthy for team roles? Who talks most/least and is that appropriate?
      Compare speaking volume to in-game role (fragger, support, caller).

  - id: callout_quality
    title: "Callout Quality"
    instruction: >
      Assess terminology consistency, timing precision, and clarity.
      Are callouts using correct QW conventions (armor by color, weapons by name)?
      Are item timing calls precise ("quad on 45") or vague ("quad soon")?
      Quote specific good and bad examples with timestamps.

  - id: weapon_tracking
    title: "Weapon Tracking"
    instruction: >
      How well does the team track enemy weapons? Look for sequential location
      callouts following a weapon carrier (e.g. "rocket red" -> "rocket tunnel").
      Are enemy weapon positions being communicated effectively?
      Does the team name specific enemies when tracking?

  - id: item_control_comms
    title: "Item Control & Communication"
    instruction: >
      Correlate item timing callouts with actual item pickups from ktxstats.
      Are items being called before pickup? Is the team coordinating for quad/pent?
      Are armor and mega pickups being reported?

  - id: overlap_analysis
    title: "Overlap Analysis"
    instruction: >
      Analyze speech overlaps. Are they complementary (two useful calls simultaneously)
      or disruptive (one player drowning out another)? When do overlaps spike?
      Which player pairs overlap most?

  - id: silence_gaps
    title: "Silence Gaps"
    instruction: >
      Identify quiet periods (gaps > 5 seconds with no voice comms).
      Do they correlate with deaths, respawns, or loss of map control?
      Are there moments where someone should have called but didn't?

  - id: comms_performance
    title: "Comms-Performance Correlation"
    instruction: >
      How do communication patterns relate to in-game performance?
      Do high-fraggers call more or less? Do communication gaps align with
      death streaks? Does the team go quiet when losing control?

  - id: intermission
    title: "Between-Map Discussion"
    instruction: >
      If intermission data is available: what is the team discussing between maps?
      Are they debriefing the previous map, planning strategy for the next,
      or just chatting/venting? Does the tone suggest good team morale?
    optional: true

  - id: player_recommendations
    title: "Player Recommendations"
    instruction: >
      Concrete per-player actions to improve communication. Be specific -
      reference exact timestamps, quotes, and examples from this match.
      Prioritize the most impactful changes.

  - id: transcription_issues
    title: "Transcription Issues"
    instruction: >
      List suspected speech-to-text errors as a markdown table with columns:
      | Heard | Likely Meant | Confidence | Timestamp | Context |
      Include: misheard player names, QW terms transcribed as English words,
      fragments that seem cut off mid-word, and any nonsensical phrases.
      Confidence should be high/medium/low based on surrounding context.
    self_improving: true
