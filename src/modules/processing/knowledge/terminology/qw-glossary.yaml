# Item timing callouts
# Weapons respawn every 30 seconds. Players have in-game clocks counting up.
# When you pick up a weapon at 12:15, you say "rocket on 45" (spawns at xx:45)
timing_patterns:
  # "[location/item] on [time]" - item spawns at that second mark of the current minute
  # "[location/item] in [x]" - item spawns in x seconds from now

# Note: "low" in callouts usually refers to a map location (low rocket, low area),
# NOT low health. Low health is expressed as "weak", "almost dead", "so dead".
